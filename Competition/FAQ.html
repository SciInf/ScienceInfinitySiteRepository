	<h3><a href="#">Q: Is reigstration individual or by team?</a></h3>
 	<div>
 	You can register anywhere from one to four people to be on a team. You must register your entire team at the same time. Be aware that if you have less than four teams, we may combine smaller teams and individuals to make teams of 4.
 	</div>

 	<h3><a href="#">Q: Can I register my student if they are in a lower grade?</a></h3>
 	<div>
 	You can register a lower grade student to participate in the 5th grade level. However, some of the questions may be too difficult for younger students.
 	</div>
 	
 	<h3><a href="#">Q: What are the rules for forming a team?</a></h3>
 	<div>
 	Teams consist of between 2-4 players, with a larger team having an advantage. Members can be from different schools and different grades. Registration can also be done as individuals. Smaller teams may be combined later to create larger teams.
 	</div>
 	
 	<h3><a href="#">Q: How are rounds scored?</a></h3>
 	<div>
 	Rounds are scored with a correct answer being full points, an incorrect answer getting no points, and a blank answer getting partial points.
 	</div>

 	<h3><a href="#">Q: Is scoring by rounds, or cumulative?</a></h3>
 	<div>
 	Both round scores and cumulative scores will be kept. Prizes will be awarded for BOTH round and cumulative performances.

 	<h3><a href="#">Q: Where can I find appropriate study material?</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="#">Q: What is the policy around cancellation of registration and what options for registration fee refund?</a></h3>
	<div>
	Unfortunately, we are unable to provide refunds for cancellations. However, if more students need to register later (for example you originally register a team of three, but then add a fourth), please complete the form again in its entirety. In cases of increasing the number of registered students, we will provide a refund on the original payment.
