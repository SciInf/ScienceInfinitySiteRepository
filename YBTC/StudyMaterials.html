<p><span class="auto-style1">To prepare for a Challenge competition, students 
should begin by reviewing CEF’s Challenge study materials “Passport” including 
the Passport to Science Exploration and the Periodic Table and the Periodic 
Table of Atomic Weights handouts. CEF’s also recommends that students seek 
additional examples, explanations, and activities to gain a better understanding 
of various chemistry concepts and be able to apply their knowledge of chemistry 
to both familiar and unfamiliar situations.</span><br class="auto-style1"></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">Challenge competition questions are based on an 
overall understanding of chemistry and general science concepts and the 
relationships among concepts. Challenge questions are largely derived from 
information contained in CEF’s study materials but are not limited solely to 
this information. We encourage you to seek additional examples and explanations 
of chemistry concepts from outside resources.</span><br class="auto-style1"></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">The information in the Passport is supplied (link 
below) to help you succeed at every level of the Challenge. The Passport is 
divided into three portions that correspond to the different levels of the 
Challenge—local, state, and national.</span><br class="auto-style1"></p>
