<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div id="mainaccordion">
    <h3><a href="#">Q: What do we teach?</a></h3>
    <div>
        We prepare middle school students in advanced topics in science to prepare them for competitions. Here are the topics that we cover. 
        <p>
        All level 1 subjects cover material from regular to honors level and level 2 subjects cover material from honors to AP level. 
        Here are the subjects that we cover.
            <ol><li>Biology 1 and 2<li> Physics 1 and 2 <li> Chemistry 1 and 2<li> Earth Science <li> Energy </ol>
    </div>
    <h3><a href="#">Q: What does the schedule look like? What activities do we do?</a></h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            For each subject, we hold a class every other sunday for 90 minutes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A good portion of the class is spent in traditional classroom setting discussing topics on the subjects.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is assigned homework and pop quizzes. Considerable self study outside classroom is expected.
            </li>
            <li> About once a month, there is scheduled testing to assess learning of the topics covered.</li>
            <li> There is oral testing using buzzers to gain practice for Science Bowl like competitions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3><a href="#">Q: Who can join?</a></h3>
    <div>
       <p>Students have to be between 5th and 8th grade.</p>
       <p>Teachers have to be at least in 9th grade and should have completed Honors/AP Level of the subject being taught.</p>
       <p>For logistic reasons a preference is given to candidates with Microsoft Affiliation for the 2016-2017 year</p>
    </div>

	<h3><a href="#">Q: How can I join?</a></h3>
	<div>
		Space is limited, so we have to come up with some criteria. Key things we look for is 
        <ol start="a"><li> Motivation</li> <li> Positive contribution in the class</li> <li> Performance</li> </ol>
		Acceptance into the class is not a free ticket to continue, we will be continuously adjusting the group membership 
		based on the above criteria. We will have a limited number of spaces for students who don't have microsoft affiliation.

	<h3><a href="#">Q: What Competitions will you prepare our students for?</a></h3>
	<div>
		<p>We want to prepare the students for the following three competitions 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NSF Science bee. http://northsouth.org. This is a written test. Some students excel in written tests. This is best for them. No space limitation. Everyone can participate.
			</li>
			<li>Science Bowl. http://science.energy.gov/nsb. This is for students who are fast. The problems here are not deep, but fast paced buzzer style competition 
            from broad areas of science. Three teams of five members each are only allowed to participate. The team members are all required to be from same school.
			</li>
            <li>Science Olympiads - Schools send contingents of 15 to 20 members</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.chemed.org/programs/challenge/">YBTC</a> - Individual Chemistry test and buzzer based with chapter, regional and national rounds</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We believe these three competitions cover the interests of all motivated students.
		</p>
		<p>
		Please note, the team formation is going to be based on performance, being a positive team member, providing positive contribution in the class, 
		team composition etc. Please honor the coach’s decision and don’t take it personally. Coach’s decision is final, please don’t ask.			
		</p>

	<h3><a href="#">Q: What is the test forrmat?</a></h3>
	<div>
		Usually the tests are multiple choice questions. This is at normal-AP level, depending on what class your studet is enrolled in. There is no prescribed syllabus.
		Students will exchange the papers and correct the test among themselves.
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#">Q: My son is ahead in school, but he is in 4th grade can he join?</a></h3>
	<div>
		There are no exceptions. What we will do is going to be hard for a 4th grader to fully participate. 
	</div>

<!--
	<h3><a href="#">Q: Do you teach?</a></h3>
	<div>
		This is a group run by volunteers. Sometimes we teach based on the group needs. 
		For the most part we administer the tests. The expectation is student will self-learn, 
		helping each other and working with their parents. We will provide guidance on what to study and 
		answer question that they are strugling with.
	</div>     -->

	<h3><a href="#">Q: What is some other reference material to study for aspiring students?</a></h3>
	<div>
		<ol>
			<li>Conceptual Physical Science (5th Edition) Paul Hewitt (This has both physical science and earth science). This is a good book. Older version should be ok too.
</li>
			<li>Physics: Principles with Applications by Douglas C. Giancoli</li>
			<li>Introductory to Chemsitry by Zumdahl</li>
			<li>Earth Science by Edward J. Tarbuck</li>
			<li>Biology, by Neil A. Campbell, Jane B. Reece</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.eia.gov/kids">Energy</a></li>
